An "open redesign" of dijifi.com. What an awesome client to be like, "Yeah, put the code on up"! Sooo much I want to write about with this project, but it will have to launch first.

And an initial implementation of the [Timber Starter Kit](https://github.com/laras126/timber-starter-kit) (which maybe needs a less generic name, as it may become less generic).
